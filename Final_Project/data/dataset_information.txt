In this document you'll find information about the datasets I am using in this project.

type_1a.txt - This is a set of 96 type 1a supernovae that had their distances determined irrespective of their redshift measurement. 
The redshifts in the dataset were independent measurements of the galaxy containing the SN. They are all taken from the SDSS database.
Originally compiled by Anneya Golob.

SDSS_lum_distance_cepheids.csv - A set of 1000 cepheid variables that had their luminosity distance determined via the period-luminosity
relationship. The redshifts in the dataset were independent measurements of the galaxy containing the cepheid. They are all taken from the SDSS database.

leda_distance.csv - A set of 4241 galaxies taken from the HyperLeda catalog. I've searched for all galaxies that have measured
redshifts and independently measured distances. This is easy to compile by entering the following into their SQL search form:
SELECT objname, mod0, vgsr WHERE mod0 IS NOT NULL
